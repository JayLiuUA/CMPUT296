		Maroon 5 is an American <span class = "rotated">pop rock band</span> that originated in Los Angeles, California.[11][12] It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. <br/>
		Original members Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.<br/>
		In 2001, the band returned and changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a different direction under the name Maroon 5.[13] At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, the band signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album as Maroon 5, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, "Harder to Breathe", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[14] In 2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed "the sleeper hit of the millennium". The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live – Friday the 13th.[15] In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007.[16] The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, "Makes Me Wonder", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.<br/>
